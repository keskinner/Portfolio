            <h1>About Kevin</h1>
            <p>Lately, my curiosity has driven me to figure out the building blocks of the world, and my goal is to rearrange them to build something even better. Learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery has helped me start that journey. I enjoy the level of determination it takes to achieve the end goal, as well as, the feeling of satisfaction gained from achieving that goal.</p>
            <p>When Iâ€™m not too busy chasing goals, I like to spend my free time watching sports or Netflix, playing video games, or having a drink with friends. I can also be found traveling or camping on the weekends.</p>
